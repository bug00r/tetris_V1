Things i want to do with this Game:

Version 1:
	- smoother controlling with Game State
		- app_state
			- input_state
			- ui_state
			- game_state
	- drawing algorithm one time Field and only Stone should be redrawn
	- add animation of line removement(maybe in Version 2 first)(Prio. 2)
	- add Options UI with all kind of states
	- More specific Scoring Algorithm(Prio. 3)
	- cleanup and document code(Prio. 1)

done:
	- rewrite field draw calculation for start extreme Tetris
		- here we have to interpolate block_size
		- Adding simple Sounds
Version 2:
	- add usage of customizing Textures

Version 3:
	- add features like:
		- rocket, bombs different Stones away
		- antigravity, for a specific time frame the stone movement slows down
		- wormhole, you can goto the left and stone reaches the right side and reverse
